# compound

## An xtsv module to annotate compound component boundaries

This xtsv module expects output generated by (at least) the tok,morph,pos emtsv modules and outputs a field labeled compound.

The compound field always contains exactly the value of the `lemma` field **except** when the word token is a verb that contains a (non-separated) preverb. In that case the `compound` field contains the verb's lemma with an '#' component boundary symbol inserted between the preverb and the verb stem, e.g. `form`: beleereszkedtek, `lemma`: beleereszkedik, `compound`: bele#ereszkedik.

TODO: The `compound` field should insert component boundary symbols into all compound words, not just verbs.

## Testing
